                Going outside for just 20 minutes a day can improve your mood. The fresh air can increase your ability
                to stay focused and your attention span. The time spent outside can give your mind relief, encourage
                exercise, and provide room to socialize. Whether itâ€™s going to the store or going to the mailbox, try to
                leave the house.

                up with or contact someone this week. To connect with people far away, consider using web-based methods

                Social connections with others can bring joy, prevent loneliness and depression, and ease stress. Today,
                social media is one of the main ways people stay connected. Although social media can enable you to stay
                in contact with friends and family, it can sometimes lead to feelings of inadequacy and isolation. This
                week use an app to track how much time you spend on social media each day. Then, set a goal to reduce
                this number. At the end of the week, reflect on your mood and the impact this modification has had.
